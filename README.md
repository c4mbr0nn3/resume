# Nuxt Resume

This is my personal resume built with Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS. It is hosted on Netlify and can be viewed [here](https://resume.francescozorzi.me/).

If you would like to use this as a template for your own resume, feel free to fork this repository and customize it to your liking.

The resume structure is based on the JSON Resume schema with markdown capabilities for project and work descriptions.

I only implemented the following sections of JSON Resume:

- Basics
- Work
- Education
- Skills
- Languages
- Projects

You can find the JSON Resume schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Nathan Friend](https://nathanfriend.io/) who inspired me with his project [Nuxt Résumé](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/nuxt-resume). I wanted to reproduce a similar look and feel without looking at the source code of his project, just a visual reference. Also, my project is much simpler since it doesn't include all Ruby generation and deployment scripts.
